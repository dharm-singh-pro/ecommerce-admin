# This is a demo Node.js project #
### Using Express for development. The project also utilizes libraries such as *multer*, *uuidv4*, and *SuperTokens* for API development

If you do not have a Node.js environment set up, follow the guide below:

1) **Install Node.js**:
  *Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en)*.

     ```
     ```
     npm -v
     ```

3) **Install Nodemon**: 
   Follow [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17975999/i-can%C2%B4t-install-nodemon-globally-nodemon-not-recognized)
      
      ```
      npm install -g nodemon
      ``` 

      >Verify the installation by running nodemon cmd in your terminal.
      ```
      nodemon -v
      ```

## APIs with jwt verification ##

### To run API endpoints directly through Postman without any frontend implementation, you'll need to make sure your Express server is set up correctly. ###

# SuperTokens #
### SuperTokens is used to manage token between backend and frontend and also provide UI to handle token accessibility. ###

> [!NOTE]
> Most of SuperTokens functionalities are available in a paid account.

***System required***

  1) **SuperToken installation**: [I followed](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/pre-built-ui/setup/core/without-docker)
     >Download supertokens [zip](https://supertokens.com/use-oss)

     ``` 
     Please select your database: MongoDB
     Please select operating system:Linux
     Version:9.0.2
 
     click to >>Download
     ```

     >Install in ubuntu system by terminal

     ``` 
     extract zip
     cd supertokens
     sudo ./install
     ```
    
     >Run below commands for run and stop to service of supertoken.
     >default server [http://localhost:3567/](http://localhost:3567/)
     
     ```
     supertokens start
     ```
     ```     
     supertokens stop
     ```
   > [!TIP]
   > To integrate SuperTokens' UI functionality, you need a frontend project. For this, ReactJS is used. [repo](https://github.com/dharm-singh-pro/ecommerce-app)
